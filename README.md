This repository implements Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict employee salaries based on their position level in a company. The code utilizes Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn's StandardScaler, and SVR for data manipulation, feature scaling, and model training/prediction.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:
Imports the Position_Salaries.csv dataset using pandas.
Separates features (X) and target variable (y).
Reshapes y to a 2D array for consistency.
Applies standard scaling to both features and target variable using StandardScaler to ensure numerical stability during model training.
SVR Model Training:
Imports the SVR class from scikit-learn's svm module.
Creates an SVR regressor instance with an RBF kernel (adjustable for different regression tasks).
Fits the model to the scaled training data (X, y).
Salary Prediction:
Defines a function to predict salary for a new position level.
Takes a position level value as input.
Scales the input using the fitted sc_X scaler.
Reshapes the input for compatibility with the SVR model.
Makes a prediction using the trained SVR regressor.
Inverse-transforms the predicted salary back to the original scale using sc_y.inverse_transform.
Returns the predicted salary as a NumPy array.
Visualization:
Creates two scatter plots to visualize the relationship between position level and salary:
One plot shows the actual data points (red).
The other plot shows the predicted salary curve using the SVR model (blue).
The first plot has a lower resolution, while the second plot uses a finer grid for a smoother curve.
Both plots have appropriate titles, labels, and legends for clarity.
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn). You can install them using pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn.
Place the Position_Salaries.csv dataset in the same directory as the Python script.
Run the script (python your_script_name.py).
Customization:

You can modify the script to:
Use different datasets for salary prediction.
Experiment with various SVR kernel types (linear, poly, etc.) to see which one performs best for your specific data.
Explore hyperparameter tuning to further improve the SVR model's accuracy.
