Introduction
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that supports linear and non-linear regression. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to implementing SVR on a sample dataset to predict salaries based on position levels.

Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is Position_Salaries.csv, which contains information about job positions and their corresponding salaries.

Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install the following Python libraries:

numpy
matplotlib
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Kodu kopyala
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/your-username/support-vector-regression.git
Navigate to the repository directory:
bash
Kodu kopyala
cd support-vector-regression
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Kodu kopyala
jupyter notebook
Open the support_vector_regression.ipynb notebook and run the cells to see the implementation of SVR.
Visualization
The notebook includes code for visualizing the SVR results. Two types of plots are generated:

Scatter Plot with SVR Fit:
This plot shows the actual data points and the SVR fit line.

Higher Resolution Plot:
This plot provides a smoother curve by predicting results at a higher resolution.
